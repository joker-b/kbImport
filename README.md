kbImport
========

A small python script that I use to import pictures, audio files, and video from a variety of different cameras and devices. Used on varying computers at different times: Mac, Linux, Windows.

All files are organized under a uniform filing system so it's easy to find images etc based on when and what, not which hardware.

Usage: insert media, then run:
   python kbImport3.py [JobName]
