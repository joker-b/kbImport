kbImport
========

Media-import pictures, audio files, and video from a variety of different cameras and devices, including AVCD and various RAW formats.
Used on varying computers at different times: Mac, Linux, Windows. This is a personal script that I have used and grown over time.

All files are organized under a uniform filing system so it's easy to find images etc based on when and what, not which hardware.

Usage: insert media, then run:
   python kbImport3.py [JobName]
